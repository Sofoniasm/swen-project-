## Example terraform.tfvars for local runs
# Copy this to infra/terraform/terraform.tfvars and edit values as needed.

# If you already have a VPC you want to reuse, set existing_vpc_id to its id and
# the Terraform configuration will select existing subnets. Otherwise leave empty
# to allow Terraform to create a new VPC (may hit VPC quota limits in the account).
existing_vpc_id = ""

# Kubernetes cluster name
cluster_name = "aiops-eks-cluster"

# Optional: customize other variables here as in variables.tf
