# Notes:
# - This ClusterIssuer uses HTTP-01 challenges. The Ingress for ArgoCD must be reachable publicly
#   and the DNS A (or CNAME) record for the host must point to the ingress controller LoadBalancer.
# - Contact email set to admin@fidevops.xyz by automation. If you'd like a different contact
#   email (for expiry notices), tell me and I'll update the file.
# - After applying, create a Certificate resource for the host (the existing ArgoCD ingress in
#   infra/k8s/argocd-ingress.yaml already references a secretName: argocd-server-tls and the
#   annotation cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer should be updated to 'letsencrypt-prod-http01' or
#   you may leave the ingress annotation and update the ingress file accordingly.
